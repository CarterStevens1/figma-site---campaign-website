        <p>“With Blueshift we went from the stone age to the modern era in the blink of an eye. And our users have noticed the difference. We’ve never had a shortage of good ideas. There were just too few hours in the day and too much reliance on other teams to execute them. Blueshift has allowed our lean marketing team to be nimble and self-sufficient. We now have the power to spin up any advanced campaign idea quickly and test it on the fly.”

        <p>“One of the biggest challenges in 1:1 marketing is the need to activate large volumes of data when you scale to millions of customers across multiple touch points. Unlike other platforms that struggle with increasing amounts of data, Blueshift becomes more powerful the more data you have in it. This has allowed us to scale our personalization efforts and customer journeys across multiple apps on different channels, and the results have been tremendous.”
